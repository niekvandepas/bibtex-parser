  abstract = {Ethnic identity is central to many contemporary discussions of belonging and assimilation of migrant-origin youth. Studies typically focus on a single minority identity. Identity theory implies, however, that individuals may hold multiple ethnic identities, or none, and these may find expression to a greater or less extent depending on context. Using a nationally representative, longitudinal study of Dutch teenagers, we investigate the role of classroom ethnic composition in shaping multiple ethnic identity expression. Framing identity choices as a relational process, we show that the number of ethnic identities that children with a migrant-origin background choose is greater for those students who are exposed to a more ethnically diverse context, while less diverse classrooms foster ethnic identification with no or fewer minority groups. Classification of migrant-origin students with a single (minority) ethnicity may thus be an oversimplification of ethnic identity, even for those from a single country of origin.},

   abstract = {Historians have argued that nationalism spread from elite groups to larger populations through public media, yet this has never been empirically proven. In this paper, we use digital tools to search for expressions of nationalism in Dutch newspaper discourse in the late nineteenth century by text mining in large newspaper repositories. The absence of emotional nationalist rhetoric in Dutch national newspapers suggests that nationalism in the late nineteenth century was much more subtle than the literature based on elite discourse tells us.},
